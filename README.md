   - Go to the repository's GitHub page.
   - Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.

2. **Open the Project in GitHub Desktop**
   - Click the **Code** button on the forked repository page.
   - Select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
   - In GitHub Desktop, click **Clone** to download the repository.

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**
   - In GitHub Desktop, click the **Open in Visual Studio Code** button to launch the project directly.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Open the **Terminal** in Visual Studio Code by clicking **Terminal â†’ New Terminal**.
   - Change the working directory to the `frontend` folder by running:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. **Run the Frontend**
   - Start the development server with the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The terminal will display a **local development URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
   - **CTRL + Click** on the displayed link to open the website in your browser.

6. **Access the Hosted Website**
   - Click on the provided **host link** (replace `'url'` with the appropriate link) to access the deployed website.

7. **Add Remote URL**
   - Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Run this command to add the upstream URL:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream <original-repository-link>
     ```

8. **Verify Remote URLs**
   To ensure everything is configured correctly, run:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   This should display both the `origin` and `upstream` URLs.

```sh
cp Backend/v1/.env.example Backend/v1/.env
```

2. Fill in your environment variables in `.env`:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Prisma database URL
- `DIRECT_URL`: Your Prisma direct connection URL

3. Never commit `.env` files or files containing secrets!
